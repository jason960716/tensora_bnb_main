Powered by OP Stack and secured by BNB, it rewards miners and validators for providing real AI, compute, and insight onchain.","Buy $TORA","How Tensora Works","Tensora transforms AI computation into a decentralized economy. It bridges compute, intelligence, and liquidity between BNB Chain and its AI-driven Layer 2, rewarding miners, validators, and subnet creators for powering real intelligence onchain.","Launch a subnet dedicated to AI inference, training, or analytics. Each subnet has its own validator set and can issue rewards based on compute output.","Provide GPU or compute power, connect through the Tensora CLI, and start earning $TORA for verified contributions. Mining is based on proof-of-intelligence — measurable work from real models.","Validators confirm computation proofs and maintain consensus. Verified results generate shared rewards between miners and subnet owners.","Bridge assets between BNB Chain and Tensora instantly, enabling developers and AI agents to access cross-chain liquidity and deploy seamlessly.","Explore","Deploy AI-powered dApps and subnets directly on Tensora. From compute networks to onchain inference, the infrastructure is designed to scale machine intelligence on BNB Chain and beyond.","Read our Docs","Tensora Roadmap","Tensora evolves continuously — new subnets, improved consensus, and expanded AI functionality are already on the horizon.","Phase 1: Tensora L2 Mainnet LaunchBridgeValidator RegistryExplorer","Phase 2: AI Mining ActivationCompute-to-EarnSubnet CreationModel Verification","Phase 3: Intelligence MarketplaceDecentralized model sharing Governance Incentive layers.","Solutions","Tensora is built around a modular system that merges AI compute, consensus, and decentralized rewards. Each module strengthens the intelligence layer on BNB Chain.","Learn More","Independent AI environments deployed on Tensora.Each subnet operates as a micro-network — hosting models, datasets, or logic. They’re managed by creators, validated by the network, and rewarded in $TORA.","A hybrid system combining Proof-of-Stake with Proof-of-Intelligence.Validators confirm both computation and result accuracy, maintaining reliability and fairness across subnets.","The engine that powers AI mining.GPU nodes perform training or inference tasks submitted by subnets. Verified compute is rewarded in real time via emission cycles.","The $TORA token drives the system.It fuels gas fees, validator staking, miner incentives, and subnet creation — anchoring Tensora’s onchain intelligence economy.","Be part of the decentralized intelligence layer on BNB Chain. Whether you’re providing compute, validating outputs, or building subnets — there’s a role for everyone in the Tensora ecosystem.","Miner","Earn by providing compute power","Contribute GPU resources","Perform AI inference and model execution","Receive rewards in $TORA","Start Mining","Validator","Secure and verify intelligence","Validate subnet outputs and accuracy","Participate in Yuma consensus","Earn validator and delegator rewards","Become a Validator","Subnet Builder","Launch your own AI network","Deploy decentralized AI subnets","Define hyperparameters and rewards","Monetize your models and datasets","Create a Subnet","Help","Get quick answers about Tensora — from the AI mining system and subnets, to bridging, staking, and earning $TORA.","If you have any further questions about Tensora.
